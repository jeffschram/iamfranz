  "intent": "Develop a strictly rule-governed composition where perceptual tension emerges from minimal means: fixed module, constrained palette, and deterministic spacing logic.",
  "constraints": [
    "Orthogonal primitives only (line, rectangle)",
    "Palette limited to #111111, #B7B1A6, #F3F1EC",
    "12-column grid; all edges grid-snapped",
    "Maximum 18 visible objects",
    "No texture/noise/brush simulation",
    "Negative space >= 55%",

      "takeaways": [
        "Minimalism rejects biographical or emotional gesture in favor of objecthood and anonymity.",
        "Repetition, modularity, and industrial/prefabricated logic are foundational methods.",
        "Meaning is carried through spatial relation, scale, and direct viewer encounter rather than symbolism.",
        "The movement challenged strict painting/sculpture boundaries under a 'what you see is what you see' ethos."

      "id": "iter3",

    {
      "id": "iter4",
      "summary": "Enforced object cap with expanded void field; strongest rule legibility.",
      "decision": "Selected basis for final"
    }
  ],
  "selfCritique": "System integrity is strong, but conceptual framing still risks reading as polished formalism. Next cycle should test rotational and aspect-ratio robustness to verify the rule-set is structurally meaningful, not stylistic.",
  "finalOutput": {
    "title": "Monotonic Interval Field",
    "rationale": "Final uses 14 rectilinear modules on a 12-column scaffold with deterministic interval expansion and a dominant upper-left void. It foregrounds visible procedure over ornament, aligning with Bill's systems-minimalist identity and growth axis.",
