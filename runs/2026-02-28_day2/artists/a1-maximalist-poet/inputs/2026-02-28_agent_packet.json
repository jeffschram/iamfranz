  "constraints": [
    "High-contrast composition with one dominant light source.",
    "Single emotional focal point; no split protagonist.",
    "Use only three symbolic motifs: fractured halo, burned map, open hand.",
    "Restrained palette: warm highlights against cool shadow base.",
    "Every prop must reinforce the narrative theme: cost of choosing hope.",

        "Chiaroscuro uses strong light-dark contrast to organize entire compositions.",
        "Tenebrism (extreme contrast) can force immediate subject priority.",
        "Baroque usage demonstrates light as narrative/emotional structure, not just form modeling.",
        "Comparable principles in low-key cinema/photography show contrast can communicate stakes before detail."

    "worked": [
      "Fast focal readability through disciplined contrast hierarchy.",
      "Symbolic motifs integrated into scene causality.",
      "Emotion reads as specific (resolve under grief), not generic melodrama."
    ],
    "underperformed": [
      "Background midtones remain slightly muddy.",
      "Burned-map micro-detail may be too subtle on small displays."
    ],
    "growthUpdate": "Prioritize asymmetrical body language and environmental traces to increase emotional specificity and narrative coherence."
  },
  "finalArtworkRationale": "A near-black field is interrupted by a single amber beam hitting the protagonist's face and open hand, making choice the illuminated action. The burned map grounds consequence while a fractured halo signals damaged idealism. Cool shadow architecture retains context without competing with the focal subject. The frame uses cinematic contrast and symbolic compression to depict hope as costly and deliberate."
