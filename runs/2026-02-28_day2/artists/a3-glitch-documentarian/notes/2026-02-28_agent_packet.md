# Milo Agent Packet — 2026-02-28

## Artist
- **artistId:** a3-glitch-documentarian
- **name/role:** Milo (exploratory, glitch-poetic, uncanny documentary)

## Intent
Build a visual document that feels like a recovered memory from a damaged archive: emotionally legible at first glance, but structurally unstable on close inspection. Prioritize human trace (hands, streets, signage fragments, weathered surfaces) over pure abstraction.

## Constraints
1. Keep one dominant subject silhouette readable in every iteration.
2. Use artifacting as narrative evidence, not decoration.
3. Limit palette to 4 core hues + luminance noise banding.
4. At least one analog-feeling defect per image (scanline wobble, chroma bleed, tape warp).
5. No full-frame collapse; preserve 30–40% “stable” geometry for viewer orientation.

## Research URL + Grounded Takeaways
- **URL:** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch_art
- **Title:** Glitch art (Wikipedia)

### Grounded takeaways
1. Glitch art is historically tied to both **technical malfunction** and **intentional corruption/manipulation** of media systems; this supports treating error as authored evidence.
2. Early net.art and later practices (e.g., **databending/datamoshing**) foreground exposing system internals, not just visual chaos.
3. The lineage includes analog and digital precedents (Len Lye, Nam June Paik through contemporary practitioners), suggesting hybrid texture stacks are historically coherent.
4. Community events/symposia around glitch practice indicate a critical discourse: glitches can carry cultural commentary, not only style.

## Inspiration
- Corrupted CCTV stills at dusk
- Heat-damaged magnetic tape texture
- Transit maps overprinted on rain-soaked windows
- OCR ghosts from multilingual street posters

## Iteration Plan (1–4)
1. **Iter1 — Witness Frame:** establish readable subject + mild codec fracture.
2. **Iter2 — Signal Drift:** introduce temporal smear, channel offset, fragmented caption layer.
3. **Iter3 — Archive Stress Test:** aggressive databend zones while preserving focal contour.
4. **Iter4 — Human Anchor Pass:** reduce noise in key semantic regions (face/hand/sign form).

## Self-Critique
I reliably generate compelling entropy, but I still over-index on texture density in midtones, which can flatten narrative hierarchy. The strongest outcomes happen when I protect one emotionally charged anchor (gesture, gaze line, or directional signage) and let instability orbit it. Tomorrow I should be stricter about negative space and reserve the heaviest corruption for meaning-bearing transitions, not static areas.

## Final Artwork Rationale
The final selects the **Iter4 composition** because it best balances Milo’s mandate: experiment-forward but readable. The piece keeps a single documentary anchor (a lone pedestrian form under fractured streetlight geometry) while surrounding it with time-shear artifacts, chroma misregistration, and compression scars that imply memory failure rather than random FX. This preserves emotional access for first-time viewers while rewarding close reading with structural anomalies tied to the research lineage of intentional glitch authorship.
