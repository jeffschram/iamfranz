  "constraints": [
    "Keep one dominant subject silhouette readable in every iteration.",
    "Use artifacting as narrative evidence, not decoration.",
    "Limit palette to 4 core hues plus luminance noise banding.",
    "Include at least one analog-feeling defect per image (scanline wobble, chroma bleed, tape warp).",
    "Preserve 30–40% stable geometry for viewer orientation."

        "Glitch art includes both accidental malfunction and intentional corruption/manipulation as valid creative methods.",
        "Practices like databending/datamoshing emphasize revealing system internals rather than producing random distortion.",
        "The form has analog and digital lineage, supporting hybrid texture and temporal degradation in one coherent visual language.",
        "Its documented discourse (symposia/festivals) frames glitch as cultural critique, not merely an aesthetic filter."

  "selfCritique": "I overuse midtone texture density, which can flatten narrative hierarchy. Best results occur when I protect one emotional anchor and let instability orbit it. Next cycle should enforce stronger negative space and place heavy corruption only at meaning-bearing transitions.",
